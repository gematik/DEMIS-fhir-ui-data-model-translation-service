The value is defined by the number of PCR cycles required for the fluorescent signal of a given product (targeted RNA) to cross the threshold (i.e. exceed background level). In general, the lower the Ct value, the greater the amount of targeted nucleic acid and vice versa. The interpretation (e.g. positive, negative, indeterminate) is determined based on a cut-off value. The submitter's lab reports the interpretation in OBX.8 segment and the specimen type in SPM.4 field of HL7 messaging.","ACTIVE","","1","","","","","","3 Self-Sustaining Sequence Replication; 3SR SR; Amplif; Amplification; Amplified; Avian influenza; Bird flu; DNA NUCLEIC ACID PROBE; DNA probe; FLUA; FLUAV; FLUAV N2; FLUV; Fowl plague; ID; Infectious Disease; InfectiousDisease; Influ; Influenza A; Influenza A virus; LAT; LCR; Ligase chain reaction; Ligation-activated transcription; Microbiology; Misc; Miscellaneous; NAA+probe; NAAT; NASBA; Nucleic acid sequence based analysis; Other; PCR; Point in time; Polymerase chain reaction; Probe amp; Probe with ampification; Probe with target amplification; QBR; QNT; Quan; Quant; Quantitative; Random; Ribonucleic acid; SDA; Spec; Strand Displacement Amplification; TMA; To be specified in another part of the message; Transcription mediated amplification; Unspecified","FLUAV N2 RNA Ct Spec Qn NAA+probe","Both","","","Ct","Influenza virus A N2 RNA [Cycle Threshold #] in Specimen by NAA with probe detection","{Ct_value}","","","Changed property from 'ThresNum' to clarify the property name.","0","0","0","","","","","","2.46","","FLUAV N2 RNA NAA+probe (Specimen) [ThreshNum]"
